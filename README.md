# Portfolio Backend
Hey there, thanks for checking out the backend of my portfolio.  
I'll add some feature over time, I'll log them here for each sub/version. 
This version of the API was overengeneered **on purpose**, just for fun, it shouldn't be any more slower/less efficient than a normal REST API (one could argue that it's even faster when chaced).

## TODO
 - BLOG API
 - Better error handling
 - Better CORS (right now it accepts everyone)

## Changelog
### v_1.0
Basic API
MongoDB integration
